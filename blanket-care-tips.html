Traveling can be an exciting and rewarding experience, but it can also come with a lot of unexpected obstacles. Whether you're embarking on a weekend getaway or planning a long journey, having the right cover can truly make all the difference. Look for features like double stitching along seams or reinforced corners to ensure your blanket stands up to wear and tear over time. Ensure that all zippers, buttons, ties, etc., work properly so they don't fail when you need them most during your travels. <br><br>  The main con here is that these bulky designs can take up a lot of space in your luggage which may not be suitable if you’re trying to save room for other items during long trips away from home.
